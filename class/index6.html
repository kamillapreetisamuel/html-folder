      <b>Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly</b> unconnected problems in
      <strong>React that we’ve encountered</strong> over five years of writing
      and maintaining tens of thousands of components. Whether you’re learning
      React, use it daily, or even prefer a different library with a similar
      component model, you might recognize some of these problems.
    </p>

    <!-- <i> and <em> tags are used to make the text to look in litalic style 
        but the different of this is only observed during the auto-reader the
        screen reader.where <em> tag emphesis the text while pronucations  
    -->

    <p>
      With Hooks, you can extract <i>stateful logic from a component</i> so it
      can be tested <em>independently and reused.</em> Hooks allow you to reuse
      stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it
      easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.

    <strike>
      We’ve often had to maintain components that started out simple but grew
      into an unmanageable mess of stateful logic and side effects. Each
      lifecycle method often contains a mix of unrelated logic.
    </strike>
    <del
      >For example, components might perform some data fetching in
      componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. However, the same
      componentDidMount method might also contain some unrelated logic that sets
      up event listeners, with cleanup performed in componentWillUnmount.
    </del>
    <s>
      Mutually related code that changes together gets split apart, but
      completely unrelated code ends up combined in a single method. This makes
      it too easy to introduce bugs and inconsistencies.</s

      <small
        >To solve this, Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions
        based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or
        fetching data), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods.
        You may also opt into managing the component’s local state with a
        reducer to make it more predictable.</small

    <!-- mark {
        background-color: blue;
        } -->

    <p>TLDR: <dfn>There are no plans to remove classes from React.</dfn></p>
    <p>
      We know that React developers are focused on shipping products and don’t
      have time to look into every new API that’s being released. Hooks are very
      new, and it might be better to wait for more examples
      <ins>of hooks</ins>and tutorials before considering learning or adopting
      them.
